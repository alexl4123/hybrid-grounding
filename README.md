# NaGG

This is our prototypical implementation of our grounder.
It is called Novel AggreGate Grounder.## Installation / How it works

Here we refer you to the folder `docs` and the three files in this folder:

1. installation.html
2. quick_start.html
3. going_into_more_depth.html 

## Example Files

We provide you with two very small example files: `test.lp` and `test_agg.lp`, and the respective output in `test_output.lp` and `test_agg_output.lp`.
