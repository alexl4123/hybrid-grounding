Newground3, which enables the efficient integration of state-of-the-art grounders with BDG, and can efficiently determine which parts of a program to ground with BDG,
will be made available to the public in Q2 2025.

Reduction of **non-ground** logic programs to **disjunctive** logic programs using body-decoupled grounding, extended by Aggregates. This is the prototype, which is mentioned in the paper: Viktor Besin, Markus Hecher, and Stefan Woltran. Body-decoupled grounding via solving: A novel approach on the asp bottleneck.
