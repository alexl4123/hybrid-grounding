# hybrid_grounding

Reduction of **non-ground** logic programs to **disjunctive** logic programs using body-decoupled grounding, extended by Aggregates. This is the prototype, which is mentioned in the paper: Viktor Besin, Markus Hecher, and Stefan Woltran. Body-decoupled grounding via solving: A novel approach on the asp bottleneck.
