History
=======

Newground was the original body-decoupled grounding prototype.
NAGG was the extension of Newground to a certain subset of aggregate-rewriting techniques.
Hybrid-Grounding combines and extends several strains of development to a unified prototype, 
which is able to rewrite a large portion of aggregates, enables a tighter coupling of rules grounded by BDG and traditional means, 
and further, extends the syntactic capabilities of the prototype to normal (recursive) programs.
