Hybrid-Grounding Documentation
============================================

The Hybrid-Grounding prototype is the next stage in the development for a unified Body-decoupled Grounding prototype.

The source code can be found in the GitHub repository Hybrid-Grounding_ (or the Fork Hybrid-Grounding-Fork_).
The experiments can be found in the GitHub-Experiments repository Hybrid-Grounding-Experiments_.
