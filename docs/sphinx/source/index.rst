Hybrid-Grounding Documentation
============================================

This prototype (Hybrid-Grounding) is the implementation of a reduction from **non-ground** logic programs to **disjunctive** logic programs using Body-decoupled Grounding.
If you want to know the documetation of **Newground**, or **NAGG**, no need to leave, you are also at the right place!
The Hybrid-Grounding prototype is the next stage in the development for a unified Body-decoupled Grounding prototype.

The source code can be found in the GitHub repository Newground_.
If you are new to this protype be sure to check-out the :ref:`installation-reference`.
